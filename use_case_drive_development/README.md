# The Boundary Between Your Code and the Web

This talk is about something important in the community. Everyday more
and more people come to ruby through rails. Then they start to build
to their application _in_ rails and not outside of rails. This is a
huge problem in our community as we don't seem to respect the boundary
between frameworks and our code. My talk is about providing a new
architecture based on solid OOP principles such as the boundary
between objects, SRP, proper logic less views, application patterns,
and good testing principles.

The talk is based on an upcoming paper on this same topic. I've done
workshops on this already. The clients are very receptive to the
approach. I've also implemented this on www.radiumcrm.com as well as
transforming the architecture of currently entrenched rails
applications.

The talk follows this format:

* Introduction
* System Design: Object roles, boundaries, protocols, patterns, and delivery mechanisms
* TDD implementation of use cases, forms, models, and other object roles
* TDD implementation of HTTP delivery mechanism using Sinatra
* Problems withs Rails & Rails style MVC approach to web applications
* The ideal stack: calling out gems that exemplify qualities mentioned in previous parts of the paper
* Wrap up & conclusion
* How to migrate and redsign current systems

Note: the paper will have been published well before the conference.
